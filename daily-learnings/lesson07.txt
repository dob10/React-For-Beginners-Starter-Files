# Passing Dynamic data with props
####################################

props are the way we get data into a Component
* props are sent to Components similar to HTML attributes
  <Component prop1="string" prop2={500} />
* non-strings must be sent with curly-brackets
* props are refrenced with this.props
  In Component:
  <tag>{this.props.prop1}</tag>


$0 and $r
* in dev tools, $0 will be the currently selected tag
* $1 is the previously selected tag ($2 is before that, and so on)
* $r is the selected component in Dev Tools
* $r is useful for selecting specific instances of the same component
  it becomes equal to "this" when selected
