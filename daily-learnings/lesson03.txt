# Creating our First Components

* To use react, use 'import React from "react"'
* your class should extends React.Component
* Every single React class needs at least one method in it, called render()
* render() returns some JSX HTML
* Must export default Class to be used elsewhere

* in index.html, the #main div is where our React app gets mounted
* You can also mount only part of a page with React, if wanted
*** research react-dom vs react
* To render to page, we need render() from react-dom
* render(JSX_HTML, DOM_element_Selector)
